This IPython notebook was used to give the Penn Medicine Predictive Healthcare
team exposure to the topic of causal inference and introduce them to some
established methods. This notebook can be presented as a Reveal.js slideshow using
the [RISE](https://github.com/damianavila/RISE) extension. Feel free to use it under
